# https://py.checkio.org/mission/triangle-angles/

# You are given the lengths for each side on a triangle.    You need to find all three angles for this triangle.    If the given side lengths cannot form a triangle (or form a degenerated triangle),    then you must return all angles as 0 (zero).    The angles should be represented as a list of integers inascending order.    Each angle is measured in degrees and rounded to the nearest integer number (Standard mathematical rounding).
# 
# 
# 
# Input:The lengths of the sides of a triangle as integers.
# 
# Output:Angles of a triangle in degrees as sorted list of integers.
# 
# Precondition:
# 0 < a,b,c â‰¤ 1000
