// You are given a string and two markers (the initial one and final). You have to find a substring enclosed between these two markers. But there are a few important conditions.
// 
// This is a simplified version of theBetween Markersmission.
// 
// The initial and final markers are always different.The initial and final markers are always 1 char size.The initial and final markers always exist in a string and go one after another.Input:Three arguments. All of them are strings. The second and third arguments are the initial and final markers.
// 
// Output:A string.
// 
// Precondition:There can't be more than one final and one initial markers.
//
